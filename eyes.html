    <!-- ESSAY -->
    <div class="sideBySideText">
      <p>Our bodies and minds are wired to observe. To do almost anything is to have observed some iteration of it before. Even in action, our bodies ceaselessly gather sensory information to inform us as life renders before us. <br><br> We are creatures of input.</p>
      <p>The mind stirs with a lifetime of information. A weight so heavy upon our shoulders: As natural as it is to take input, it is just as natural to express outward. To gesture, to talk, to draw, to write, to document.<br><br> We are creatures of output.</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven to understand the world around us is one of the first relationships we enter as humans. Lloyd says, “If human curiosity isn’t fed, then you die inside ... A quarter of your desire to be alive is cut away.” We desire to grow, and in order to grow we, of course, must learn. However, underlying all this beauty of sensitivity and expression is the pure necessity of information. As Charles Eames states, “Beyond the age of information is the age of choices.” We know that the key to having increased choice and control over our lives is to gather information that we previously did not have. Information is indeed power: our desire to collect and organize the information around us, encapsulates aspects of our lives we previously did not have enough control over: natural trends, quantifying property, processing efficiency, and human behavior, to name just a few. In this section I will be exploring our modern day habit of documentation through data collection, understanding where and why a seemingly innocuous habit, exacerbated by technology, continues to paint a murky future for us: assessing why we value data, data creation, data storage, and how the ways in which theses systems operate affect users in turn. <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data collection is a long standing practice – in order to understand our relationship with data, we must think about why objectivity is even valuable to us in the first place. As stated by science historians, Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison, “the history of the various forms of objectivity might be told as how, why, and when various forms of subjectivity came to be seen as dangerously subjective”(82). The danger here is not misinformation, but instead it is perception of self. Epistemology has a long and ever-expanding history, but Daston and Galison’s specific account of nineteenth century atlas makers (the time’s pinnacle data analyzers and visualizers) striving to achieve objectivity with newfound technologies of precision (machines, photos, and digital images) was “a struggle of inward temptation”, a concept I would like to draw modern-day similarities to. The moral remedies these atlas makers sought “were those of self-restraint [...] Seventeenth century epistemology aspired to the viewpoint of angels; nineteenth century objectivity aspired to the self-discipline of saints”(82). In this case, it can be said that a researcher has a natural inclination to assess its current processes for fault, and develop new ways to counteract inadequate methodologies. However, this moral aspect of objectivity is a landmark where we can begin to see feelings of inadequacy drive our desire to better our documentation practices. Throughout science we continue to see the value in meticulous objectivity which requires painstaking, “care and exactitude, infinite patience, unflagging perseverance, preternatural sensory acuity, and an insatiable appetite for work”(83), rather than the wildness and immaturity of subjectivity. “It is [...] a profoundly moralized vision, of self-command trumping over the temptations and fragilities of flesh and spirit”(83). As we strive towards this ideal image of the perfect observer, we run away from anything less than what may paint us as unyielding angels and saints of objectivity.  <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it was convenient that at this time machines were increasingly becoming more and more relevant in research: “it was a nineteenth century commonplace that machines were paragons of certain human virtues. Chief among these virtues were those associated with work: patience, indefatigable, ever alert machines would relieve human workers whose attention wandered, whose pace slackened, whose hand trembled. Scientists praised automatic recording devices and instruments in much the same terms. [...]  It was not simply that these devices saved the labor of human observers; they surpassed human observers in the laboring virtues: they produced not just more observations but better observations”(83). Taking the morality of objectivity and the usage of machines to aid in our self-image of pious documenters, all of our objectivity is steeped in the subjective need to be perfect, to evade any sense of unkempt perspective, as this would only diminish the perceived gain of choice and control that we obtain when gathering more knowledge. In our hasty desires, we’ve lost sight of our humble goals of understanding the world around us, and instead only wish to find means of controlling it. It is here where shame within ourselves takes hold: what started out as a mere instinct and given behavior has morphed into untethered dissatisfaction of our current abilities for perfect documentation and subsequently perfect control, resulting in a crazed drive to quantify and crunch all aspects of our lives into data with the help of infallible machinery. <br><br>

      Machines of information collecting → machines of control <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data in of itself is not an evil entity, nor is the act of collecting it, processing it, or utilizing it. Yet it is common knowledge at this point, the dangers and consequences of aggressive data collection seen right before our eyes. From headlines, to word-of-mouth, to research papers and facebook group posts: It’s no secret nowadays that our day-to-day data is constantly being collected, skewed, gnarled, contorted and reduced– knowingly and unknowingly. This data spans from obvious things such as social media activity and web browsing, to ‘big data’ breadcrumbs such as the geographic data off your credit card (Reinventing Society In The Wake Of Big Data). These collection methods and processes exist in most all crevices of our technology-dependent lives– having started as surplus data solely for product improvement, to the become highly valued user behavior data in the age of surveillance capitalism,  which “unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data”(Zuboff).  In our efforts to collect and document our lives and the lives of people around us, it seems it has been forgotten that, “The issue is one of trust, knowing and being known is a mutual exchange,” not something that can or should be done as an invisible observer. As Microsoft Researchers Kate Crawford and Danah Boyd state: “There is a considerable difference between being in public and being public, which is rarely acknowledged by Big Data researchers. (11)” (Six provocations). The positioning of the observer and the observer is only one point in which shame can appear: the lack of trust that the observer will accurately understand their subject. <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This untethered dissatisfaction, never being satisfied by the amount of control over others, and thus requiring more information, has resulted in neurotic documentation of data (technology’s memory), and hyperfocusing on specific points (data bias) based on the focals points of those in power, who want to stay in power. “Manovich writes of three classes of people in the realm of Big Data: ‘those who create data, [...] those who have the means to collect it, and those who have expertise to analyze it’ (2011). (12) (Six provocations). One can see where bias starts to sprinkle into our data. One might point to the general “need people have to see themselves in ways that feel better” resulting in the messy quandary of wielding data we see today. There is a strong desire to see ourselves as empirical, logical, reasoning people, as opposed to the shame of being ignorant. “The more we are led to interpret ourselves in the light of the disengaged picture, to define our identity by this, the more the connected epistemology of naturalism will seem right and proper to us. Or otherwise put, a commitment to this identity generates powerful resistances against any challenges to the naturalist outlook. In short, its epistemological weaknesses are more than made up for by its moral appeal. (Tenacious assumptions 21). If we can contort the very epistemological nature of data collection to our ego’s whim, so too can we do the same with every byte of data we decide to or not decide to collect. <br><br><br>


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are practices that should lead us to improve our lives and the lives of the people around us, and in many cases it has. However, it  does not take one long to see that that is often not the case. Take these three past studies for example:<br><br>

      Input <br><br>
      An average of 170 of an individual’s Facebook likes 
      Smartphone metadata, such as number of received/sent text messages, the number of recipients orsenders, and message word length.
      An individual’s typing
      GPS traces, telephone numbers, call and SMS history, Bluetooth and WLAN history, and social connections.
      Output
      Accurate prediction of ethnicity, religious and political views, relationship status, gender, sexual orientation, person’s consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and drugs, and likelihood that the individual’s parents were divorced. 
      A user’s personality, based on the “Big Five Model” (Extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) can be predicted at 75.9% accuracy,
      Accurate prediction of an individual’s emotional state at above 77% accuracy. 
      Potential ability to predict where a person’s probable geographic position would be the next day, based on smartphone data
       → Increased accuracy, decreased perceptibility of input <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this information merely and briefly demonstrates the pervasiveness and capabilities of user data analysis. These technological feats, if standing by themselves, could illustrate a technologically competent and able future; However, the political and economic environment that these technological capabilities reside in, raise concern in a multitude of ways: Notably, that the information being exposed here is collected with little concern over user privacy and a lack of regard to user meaningful consent. Cybersecurity service provider, mnemonic, in collaboration with the Norwegian Consumer Council conducted a review of data sharing by popular mobile apps in 2020. They “observed the apps sending more than 88.000 HTTP requests, communicating with at least 216 unique third-party domains (*.example.com), owned by at least 135 different companies within the advertising space” (mnemonic security test). Many are aware today that this is common practice for social media platforms, apps, websites and anyone asking to accept ‘cookies.’ But so what does it matter that our innocent likes and dislikes, attributes and characteristics are collected? Targeting advertising may not be of care to some. <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a governmental level, it’s been confirmed that the “U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), has contracted with a data profiling firm called Venntel [34]. Venntel obtains its smartphone-user data from various sources, including ad firms and weather apps [34]. CBP has used Venntel’s services to identify mobile device locations within a selected area or to identify a specific user of a device [34]” (Ending Privacy’s Gremlin). Other claims have been made including that the FBI, with the intention of locating hacker infrastructure, has purchased “netflow” data (IP traffic information), but also may reveal user browsing data. The Secret Service has also reportedly “purchased location data to seize illegal credit card skimmers installed in gas pumps”(“The Clocks …”). And similarly, the Internal Revenue Service “tried (unsuccessfully, it claims) to pinpoint tax offenders by cross-referencing purchased location data with its knowledge about where suspicious transactions took place.” In this article, the author expresses the collective concern that these various examples display the Supreme Court largely overlooking the fourth amendment in lieu of the new reality of what constitutes a ‘digital search’: “When the government buys broker data without probable cause, it flouts our supermajority grant,56 surreptitiously subjects blameless citizens to "near perfect surveillance,”().  It seems, “Without suitable privacy laws, the Fourth Amendment is the last bulwark standing in the way. And in recent decades, the Supreme Court has largely failed to wield it-despite repeated reports of government abuse 60”(The Clocks Are Striking Thirteen). As recent current day events such as women’s reproductive rights being at risk, gender orientation and increasing censorship, the overlooking of the Fourth Amendment has the potential to put many citizens at risk, “recklessly expos[ing us to the possibility of] stalking, harassment, blackmail, public shaming, and arbitrary persecution for our "familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations"(“The Clocks …”). This is something our everyday technologies not only overlook, but benefit from and act as a foundational aspect of our entire relationship with technology, shoddily dissecting our interactions and activity, and using that knowledge to place us in personality categories and predicting future behavior. So we are seeing that data collection itself, grotesquely has been emerging from. Technology has turned from being a tool for understanding, and instead a tool for power. <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An integral aspect of technology is its ability to document information, to store words, pictures, videos, and more. It’s no news that digital storage capabilities revolutionized communication and systems of information, allowing for greater information accessibility and preservation. As stated within the article ‘Technologies of Memory,’ “Embedded within much technological discourse is a Utopian, techno-centric belief in an infallible memory-machine, in contrast to a notionally capricious, context-dependent and therefore fallible human memory.” However, it is quite common knowledge at this point that digital storage is both a prevalent blessing and curse. Once something has been released onto the internet, it is near impossible to erase. Even if it were to be erased, as legislation has attempted in the past, the act of getting it erased likely only adds to the issue via the Streisand Effect: “trying to suppress information can backfire by drawing attention to the information you are trying to suppress.” <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that daunting aspect in mind, coupled with knowing much data is constantly being collected unknowingly and skewed, one could draw connections between the internet’s memory capacity and being aware of one’s own limitations in the presence of a seemingly omnipotent digital entity. Ubel states, “it was Nietzsche (1966b), whose parable of the Ugliest Man in Thus Spoke Zarathustra Tillich references, who averred that the very notion of an all-seeing God contributes to the production of shame.” While it’s a bold statement to claim that digital memory could be compared to an all-seeing G-d, the effects of having media uploaded online, whether it be pictures, videos, text, audio, etc. creates a relationship between user and device where the user loses a major amount of agency and control. All the while also increasing feelings of being observed and scrutinized. The elusivity of expressing/exposing yourself and your identity through media and not knowing how it’s being used, viewed, or perceived can cause tantamount uncertainty and shame. Moreover, in the case of technology’s memory, the near-permanent aspect of the internet’s memory results in a sense of disintegrative shame. It’s not difficult to think of an example on the internet where an individual is __. As Sheila Brown, author of The Criminology of Hybrids: Rethinking Crime and Law in Technosocial Networks, states, “... endlessly circulating, shifting, pixels affect real lives … real humiliations and human pains are generated; and real relations of (patriarchal) power and exploitation are reproduced and reinforced.”<br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key point I’d specifically like to call attention to is the comparability between the mechanics of control and shame. Both hold the key to user agency. Likewise, both hinge on the presence of visibility. If information is key to choice and subsequently control, we can begin to see the slippery slope that these elements lie upon. Untethered dissatisfaction here results in neurotic documentation of data (technology’s memory), and hyperfocusing on specific points (data bias) based on the focals points of those in power, who want to stay in power. This is an issue of power that is not new nor novel, and an unfortunate truth of this reality is that trying to change the wrong-doer is often futile. However, as Alexander Stein states, we can instead aim our focus on those who are not consciously falling prey to the systems in place, and those who are willing to implement smaller scale experimentation, research, and solutions. By acknowledging the presence of shame within our technologies, we can start to better understand why technologies that set out with good intentions, may turn sour, driving us further and further away from ourselves and initial goals.  <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s been spoken about so far does not even touch the surface of the shame and aggressive nature of interacting with technology on a personal level. “By pitting us against each other in these endless shame spirals, Big Tech has successfully prevented us from building solidarity and punching up against the actual enemy, which is them. The first step is for us to critically observe their manipulations and call them what they are: shame machines.” While shame has potential to improve community and increase empathy, this isn’t the case for social media. As PhilosophyTube states, “It's a habit that is making me hate myself, and it's making me unfairly contemptuous towards others”(). “The evolution of social media has been fueled by the human impulse to communicate and by advances in digital technology. It is a story about establishing and nurturing personal connections at scale” (LINK).
