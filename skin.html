    <!-- ESSAY -->
    <p>
  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key point I’d specifically like to call attention to is the comparability between the mechanics of control and shame. Both hold the key to agency, for users and innovators alike. Likewise, both hinge on the presence of visibility. If information is key to choice and subsequently control, we can begin to see the slippery slope that these elements lie upon. Untethered dissatisfaction here results in neurotic documentation of data, and hyperfocusing on specific points based on the focals points of those in power, who want to stay in power. This is an issue of power that is not new nor novel, and an unfortunate truth of this reality is that trying to change the wrong-doer is often futile. However, as Alexander Stein states, we can instead aim our focus on those who are not consciously falling prey to the systems in place, and those who are willing to implement smaller scale experimentation, research, and solutions. By acknowledging the presence of shame within our technologies, we can start to better understand why technologies that set out with good intentions, may turn sour, driving us further and further away from ourselves and initial goals. “Visibility, and the control it allows, defines all work sites, regardless of what is being manufactured or supplied. Vision is power, and infrastructure is built for and by a world that believes in this philosophy: its image is carefully controlled and constructed, and the capacity for watching and being watched becomes its own infrastructure” (LINK). <br><br>
